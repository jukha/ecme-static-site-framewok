# ECME Governance Overview

Governance in ECME is community-driven and fully on-chain. Proposals, votes, and execution paths are encoded into smart contracts.

## Key Concepts:

- **Proposal Lifecycle:** Draft → Review → Vote → Execute
- **Voting Power:** Based on token/stake delegation
- **Roles:** Proposers, Validators, Delegates

## Governance Tools:

- Proposal builders
- Vote aggregators
- Snapshot integration (planned)

*More specifics on proposal formatting and execution rights will be added as the governance system matures.*
