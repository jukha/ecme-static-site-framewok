# DAO Organizational Structure

The ECME DAO is organized for resilience and clarity. Its modular structure allows delegation, specialization, and autonomy.

## Units & Roles:

- **Core Council:** Oversees core upgrades and policy.
- **Community Units:** Handle outreach, education, and documentation.
- **Dev Pods:** Build and maintain ecosystem tools.
- **Auditor Nodes:** Independently verify execution correctness.

## Decision-Making Layers:

1. **Emergency Council:** Acts on critical time-sensitive events.
2. **Technical Committees:** Approve complex proposals.
3. **Governance Voters:** The broader community of stakeholders.
