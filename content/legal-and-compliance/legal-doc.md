# Legal and Compliance

ECME is an open-source framework. However, its usage may involve jurisdiction-specific regulations.

## Key Topics:

- **Open Source Licensing:** ECME is released under an MIT or similar license.
- **User Responsibility:** ECME provides tooling; usage must comply with local laws.
- **Data Protection:** You are responsible for user data privacy under GDPR or equivalent.

## Disclaimer:

The ECME maintainers provide no warranties. The framework is a toolkit; deploying it into production requires independent risk assessment.
