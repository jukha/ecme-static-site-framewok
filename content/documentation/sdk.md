# ECME SDK Overview (Under Development)

The ECME Software Development Kit (SDK) provides a comprehensive set of tools, libraries, and documentation to help you seamlessly integrate your applications and services with the ECME framework.

## What You'll Find in the SDK:

This section is currently being developed to provide detailed guidance. It will cover:

1.  **Installation and Setup:** How to get the SDK running in your development environment.
2.  **Core Libraries:** Key modules and functions for interacting with ECME services.
3.  **Authentication & Authorization:** SDK-specific methods for managing access.
4.  **Examples & Use Cases:** Practical code examples demonstrating common integration patterns.
5.  **Reference Documentation:** Detailed API references for all SDK components.
6.  **Supported Languages:** Information on which programming languages the SDK is available for.

## Getting Started:

We recommend reviewing the Installation and Protocol Overview pages first, as the SDK builds upon those core concepts.
