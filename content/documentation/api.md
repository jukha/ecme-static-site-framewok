This section is being actively populated. It will include:

1.  **Base URLs and Endpoints:** Where to send your API requests.
2.  **Authentication:** How to authenticate your API calls (e.g., API Keys, OAuth).
3.  **Request & Response Formats:** Details on expected JSON structures for requests and responses.
4.  **Error Codes:** A complete list of API error codes and their meanings.
5.  **Rate Limits:** Information on API call limits.

## Available Endpoints:

Each API endpoint will be thoroughly documented, including:

* **HTTP Method:** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* **Path:** (e.g., `/vaults/{id}`, `/users`)
* **Parameters:** Query parameters, path parameters, request body.
* **Example Requests & Responses:** Code snippets for various programming languages.
