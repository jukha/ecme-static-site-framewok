# 🔐 ZuzNet — Cryptographic Infrastructure for Autonomous Digital Vaults

## 🚀 Introduction

**ZuzNet** is a cryptographic infrastructure that transforms any digital asset into a **self-executing, off-chain private, and legally resilient vault**, capable of activating without any user interaction, servers, or identification.

**ZuzNet** eliminates traditional dependencies on addresses, accounts, and smart contracts — combining the power of the **Sui blockchain**, decentralized **IPFS** storage, anonymous **post-quantum cryptography**, and local **P2P agents** that execute the user's off-chain logic described in **`.vault.json` + EDR (Event Driven Rules)** format.

---

## 🔁 A New Paradigm of Ownership

ZuzNet represents a **new ownership model**, where asset logic lives **outside the blockchain** — but gets validated and notarized by the chain **only when conditions are met**.

Unlike traditional smart contracts, ZuzNet works in **airgapped environments**, requires **no frontend**, stores **no addresses**, and operates independently of any network service.

The user controls only their **private keys** and signed `.vault.car` archives.

---

## ⚖️ Legal Perspective: **Free & Open Source**

ZuzNet removes all potential points of control or intervention:

- 🚫 No addresses, accounts, identifications or centralized logic
- 📝 No executors — only signed user intent
- 🗃 No server-side data storage
- 🛡 Not subject to DSA, GDPR, OFAC, AML — no addresses, no operators
- 🌐 The entire ZuzNet architecture is 100% Free and Open Source — available for anyone to use, modify, audit, extend, or self-host.

## 🔐 ZuzNet Components

**ZuzNet** is a privacy-focused protocol that transforms any digital asset into a **self-contained, off-chain, legally resilient vault** — called a **Locker** — that can unlock and act **without servers, addresses, or identities**.

It combines:

- 🧱 **Move 2024 smart contracts** (on Sui) for on-chain proof
- 📦 **IPFS-based storage** for logic and encrypted data
- 🧠 **P2P agents** to monitor and trigger events
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Anonymous cryptography** (Ring Signatures, zk-Proofs)
- 🛠 **EDR (Event-Driven Rules)** for programmable behavior

## ⚙️ How It Works — In 2 Simple Steps

### 1️⃣ Create a Vault

Upload your asset and package it.

### 2️⃣ Write Logic in `vault.json`

Describe in plain English when, how, and by whom it should be executed.

---

## 🧠 What Is Vault Logic?

Vault logic is a simple set of instructions like:

> “Give access to this file — but only after January 1st, 2026, and only if the right person claims it.”

Or:

> “Send this token if a secret proof is provided — otherwise, wait 30 days and send it to someone else.”

---

### ✅ Everything else is automatic:

- ⏱ **Time-based triggers**
- 🔐 **Conditions verification**
- 📦 **Permanent storage** (IPFS)
- 🧾 **Claim execution** (if needed) on blockchain
- 📤 **Send a file** to a specific email or IPFS address
- 🧨 **Destroy the content** after a deadline passes
- 📨 **Push a webhook** to notify a DAO or service
- 📁 **Unlock a document** locally using a secret key
- 🔁 **Reassign the vault** to another party automatically
- 📦 **Drop a package** into a P2P network (I2P, IPFS, Arweave)
- 🔕 **Do nothing** — silently expire or self-delete

All handled by the **ZuzNet protocol and autonomous agents** — **no servers, no accounts, no KYC.** You define the rules — ZuzNet takes care of the rest.
