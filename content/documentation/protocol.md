# ECME Framework Protocol (Coming Soon)

This document will outline the fundamental communication protocols that underpin the ECME static site framework. Understanding these protocols is key to leveraging the full power and flexibility of the system.

## Key Areas to be Covered:

Currently, this section is under active development. Future content will include:

1.  **Request/Response Flow:** How data is requested, processed, and returned within the framework.
2.  **Data Serialization:** Formats and standards used for data exchange (e.g., JSON, YAML, custom formats).
3.  **Authentication & Authorization:** Mechanisms for securing communication and access to resources.
4.  **Error Handling:** Standardized error codes and response structures.
5.  **Extension Points:** How custom protocols or extensions can be integrated.

## Purpose of This Section:

The "Protocol Overview" is intended to serve as a technical reference for developers looking to extend the framework, integrate with external systems, or debug communication issues.
