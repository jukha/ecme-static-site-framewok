# Welcome to My Brand New Page!

This page was created to demonstrate how effortlessly new content can be added to the website. Simply drop a Markdown file into the `content/` directory, and it automatically becomes a new route.

## Key Features

* **Automatic Routing:** No need to manually configure routes for each new Markdown file.
* **Simple Content Creation:** Write your content using easy-to-learn Markdown syntax.
* **Integrated Styling:** Content is automatically styled to match the template's look and feel.

### Markdown Elements Supported

You can use various Markdown elements to structure your content:

* **Bold text** and *italic text*.
* [Links to other pages](/docs/about) or [external websites](https://google.com).
* Inline `code snippets`.

Here's an example of a code block:

```javascript
// A simple JavaScript function
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
